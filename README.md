# Using AerisWeatherMap in iOS9 with Swift
Basically following the installation guide on <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/">Aeris_IOS_SDK</a>

## Details

1. Download the SDK <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/">Aeris_IOS_SDK</a>

2. Obtain API access keys by <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/">registration</a>

3. Pick components of Aeris iOS SDK, for this assignment we can only use Aeris, AerisUI and AerisMap

4. Install <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking 2.0</a> Using CocoaPods. AFNetworking is a required dependency for the Aeris iOS SDK and must be version 2.0 or higher
	1. Downloading AfNetworking <br>
	2. Install CocoaPods <br>
		a. Go to <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> and follow the instruction to install it<br>
	3. Go to your project directory from terminal, then run the following command.<br>
		a. touch Podfile<br>
		b. open -a Xcode Podfile<br>
		c. copy folloing code into the Podfile<br>
			```platform :ios, '7.0'
			pod "AFNetworking", "~> 2.0"```
		d. pod install<br>
	4. After installing AFnetworking, closing current XCode project if it is open, then go to your working directory and open the xxx.xcworkspace just created<br>

5. Go back to the <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/">Aeris_IOS_SDK</a> tutorial and we are now in step5. 
	1. Skipped. (Since we should have the xcworkspace opened alreadt. )
	2. Drag Aeris.framework, AerisUI.framework and AerisMap.framework into your project in XCode. When prompted, select <b>Copy items into destination groupâ€™s folder</b>.
	3. Same to 3 under step5 of <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/">Aeris_IOS_SDK</a> 
	4. Same to 4 
	5. Same to 5
	6. Same to 6
	7. Creating Bridge header for our swift project <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html">Swift and Objective-C in the Same Project</a>
		1. click new file -> file -> Header in Xcode
		2. name of the header file: FileyourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h (i.e. test-Bridging-Header.h)
		3. open the bridge header we just create, add the required header files by copying and pasting the three lines from 7 under step 5 (<a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/">Aeris ios sdk</a>), which should look like #import <Aeris/Aeris.h> ...
		4. in Building Setting, the one next to Building Phases, in Swift Compiler - Code Generation, add the bridging header file path. If it is under the root of your project, it should be similar to "test-Bridging-Header" (don't put "" into it)
	8. Try build the project and there should be no error. Check below if you see some error. If there is no error
		1. Go to the viewController where you want to use the map. 
		2. 
		```
		let aerisConsumerId = "Your id goes here"
        let aerisConsumerSecret = "your secret number goes here"
        AerisEngine.engineWithKey(aerisConsumerId, secret: aerisConsumerSecret)
        ```
		3. build to see if there is error
6. Adding AWFWeather Map <a href="http://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/toolkits/aeris-ios-sdk/getting-started/weather-maps/">Aeris WeatherMap</a>
	1. 	
	```
		let location = CLLocationCoordinate2D(
            latitude: some double number,
            longitude: some double number
        )
    ```
    2. ```
    	let weatherMap:AWFWeatherMap = AWFWeatherMap.init(mapType: AWFWeatherMapType.Apple)
        // you can set center by weatherMap.setMapCenterCoordinate
        weatherMap.weatherMapView.frame = self.view.bounds
        self.view.addSubview(weatherMap.weatherMapView)                        
    	// you can later add layer by weather.addLayerType()
    	```

## Build Error
1. "Undefined symbols for architecture arm64":
	a. Go back to 6 under step5
	b. add $(inherited) to the Other Linker Flags.
